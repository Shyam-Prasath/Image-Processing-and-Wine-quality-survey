# Image Processing and Wine Quality Survey

## Description
This repository contains two projects:

### 1. Image Processing
A Python script that performs basic image processing tasks such as resizing, cropping, and applying filters to an input image.

### 2. Wine Quality Survey
A machine learning project built in Python using pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. The project analyzes a dataset (`wine.csv`) containing various features of wine and predicts the quality of wine based on those features.

## Projects:

### 1. Image Processing:
- **File:** `image_processing.py`
- **Description:** Performs basic image processing tasks.
- **Usage:** Run the `image_processing.py` file using Python 3, providing the path to the input image as a command-line argument.

### 2. Wine Quality Survey:
- **File:** `model.ipynb`
- **Description:** Analyzes wine quality based on various features using machine learning techniques.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Python 3
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
- **Usage:** Open and run the `model.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment. Make sure to have the `wine.csv` dataset in the same directory.

## Dataset:
- **File:** `wine.csv`
- **Description:** Contains various attributes and quality ratings of wine samples.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Follow the instructions in each project's README file to run the respective code.
